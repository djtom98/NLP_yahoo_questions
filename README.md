*A few examples with their predicted outputs for each of the three implementations - maybe with lime or something?*

### Performance Comparison
|                      | Avg Precision | Avg Recall | Avg Accuracy |
|----------------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Baseline             |               |            |              |
| RNN                  |               |            |              |
| Bert                 |               |            |              |


*A few examples with their predicted outputs for each of the three implementations
Error Analysis of the models: where did it learn well / bad ?
Comment the metrics: can you explain the metrics difference between implementations? Where do you stand regarding SOA/random classifiers?
Biases: Try to identify any type of bias in the models
Improve your BERT solution depending on error analysis, biases or other analysis you think is relevant*

# Discussion and Conclusion
*Next steps: What are the main limitations of your models? What would be the next steps to improve it?*
